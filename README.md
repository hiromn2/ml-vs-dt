# 🧠 Machine Learning Modelling of Utility and Probability Weighting in Decision Theory

This repository contains the **reproduction package** for the working paper *"Machine Learning Modelling of Utility and Probability Weighting in Decision Theory"*.

The project investigates how machine learning methods can model and predict human decision-making under risk, comparing traditional economic frameworks (like **Cumulative Prospect Theory**) with **data-driven** and **hybrid** approaches.

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal is to compare three broad classes of models:

1. **Economic Models** – grounded in behavioral economics (e.g., Cumulative Prospect Theory).
2. **Pure Machine Learning Models** – fully data-driven (e.g., random forests, regularized regressions).
3. **Hybrid Models** – neural networks that embed economic theory into their structure or loss function.

This comparison provides insights into how well each class captures **utility curvature** and **probability weighting**, two central features of decision-theoretic behavior.
